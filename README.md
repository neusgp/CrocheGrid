# About CrocheGrid

This small app let's you build a grid and select cells to create a sort of map to do croche patterns.
It's built using React, Typescript and CSS. Deployed in Vercel. 

The idea of this tool came from Helena, a friend who knows how to knit.

Here is Helena using the app. She suggested adding numbers for each column and row so that she can understand better the pattern.
